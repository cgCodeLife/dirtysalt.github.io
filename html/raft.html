MIT-6.824课程里面给的raft论文是个扩展版本 &lt;In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version)&gt;.
</p>

<p>
相比Paxos, Raft算法更强调可以理解性。Raft算法更符合工程师按照直觉涉及出来的算法：
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>我们要选一个leader出来，由这个leader决定要做什么事情</li>
<li>这个leader肯定是要多数servers选举出来的(quorum).</li>
<li>每个leader都有一个任期(term), 每次选举都会将term+1.</li>
<li>leader election的选择标准则是根据两个指标决定的
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>接受到的日志里面，谁接受到的最大term更大，谁就是leader</li>
<li>如果最大term都一样的话，那么谁收到的日志数量更多，谁就是leader</li>
</ul></li>
<li>日志是一个数组，维护着三个下标：
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>接收下标 lastReceived. 收到一条日志就会+1, 但是有可能会回滚。</li>
<li>提交下标 lastCommitted. leader会定时将自己确定commited的下标发送给followers, follower只需要更新到最大的下标就行。绝对不会回滚。</li>
<li>执行下标 lastApplied. 这个下标相当于追随lastCommitted，只要committed的话就可以执行了。</li>
</ul></li>
<li>如何决定某个log entry是否应该commmit
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>在正常情况下，commit与否是由leader来判断的。只要leader确定有majority收到了某个log entry，那么就认为是commit了。</li>
<li>但是如果期间出现leader election的话，新的leader上来会提交一个no-op的log entry. 如果确定这个log entry被commit的话，那么之前的log肯定也被commit了。</li>
<li>followers在接受log的时候，如果发现lastReceived和leader发送的log index对不上的话，可以要求补齐。</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
论文里面还提到了许多其他实现问题比如：
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>实现动态membership change</li>
<li>实现完整的状态(snapshot)传输</li>
<li>通过随机化election timeout时间来减少split votes问题</li>
</ol>

Rafe FAQ
</p>

<pre class="example">
how does a server learn about newly elected leader?
  new leader sees yes votes from majority
  others see AppendEntries heart-beats with a higher term number
    i.e. from the new leader
  the heart-beats suppress any new election

what if old leader isn't aware a new leader is elected?
  perhaps old leader didn't see election messages
  perhaps old leader is in a minority network partition
  new leader means a majority of servers have incremented currentTerm
    so old leader (w/ old term) can't get majority for AppendEntries
    so old leader won't commit or execute any new log entries
    thus no split brain
    but a minority may accept old server's AppendEntries
      so logs may diverge at end of old term


Q: Does Raft sacrifice anything for simplicity?

A: Raft gives up some performance in return for clarity; for example:

- Every operation must be written to disk for persistence; performance
  probably requires batching many operations into each disk write.

- There can only usefully be a single AppendEntries in flight from the
  leader to each follower: followers reject out-of-order
  AppendEntries, and the sender's nextIndex[] mechanism requires
  one-at-a-time. A provision for pipelining many AppendEntries would
  be better.

- Servers may not be able to take much advantage of multi-core because
  operations must be executed one at a time (in log order).

下面一段文字是关于Raft和Paxos等共识算法在实际应用中的比较
</p>

<pre class="example">
Q: Is Raft used in real-world software, or do companies generally roll
their own flavor of Paxos (or use a different consensus protocol)?

A: There are several real-world users of Raft: Docker
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/raft/), etcd (https://etcd.io),
and MongoDB. Other systems said to be using Raft include CockroachDB,
RethinkDB, and TiKV. Maybe you can find more starting at
http://raft.github.io/

On the other hand, my impression is that most state-machine
replication systems are based on the Multi-Paxos and Viewstamped
Replication protocols.

Q: What is Paxos? In what sense is Raft simpler?

A: There is a protocol called Paxos that allows a set of servers to
agree on a single value. While Paxos requires some thought to
understand, it is far simpler than Raft. Here's an easy-to-read paper
about Paxos:

  http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2014/papers/paxos-simple.pdf

However, Paxos solves a much smaller problem than Raft. To build a
real-world replicated service, the replicas need to agree on an
indefinite sequence of values (the client commands), and they need
ways to efficiently recover when servers crash and restart or miss
messages. People have built such systems with Paxos as the starting
point; look up Google's Chubby and Paxos Made Live papers, and
ZooKeeper/ZAB. There is also a protocol called Viewstamped
Replication; it's a good design, and similar to Raft, but the paper
about it is hard to understand.

These real-world protocols are complex, and (before Raft) there was
not a good introductory paper describing how they work. The Raft
paper, in contrast, is relatively easy to read and fairly detailed.
That's a big contribution.

Whether the Raft protocol is inherently easier to understand than
something else is not clear. The issue is clouded by a lack of good
descriptions of other real-world protocols. In addition, Raft
sacrifices performance for clarity in a number of ways; that's fine
for a tutorial but not always desirable in a real-world protocol.


Q: How does Raft's performance compare to Paxos in real-world applications?

A: The fastest Paxos-derived protocols are probably faster than
Raft as described in the paper; have a look at ZAB/ZooKeeper and Paxos
Made Live. On the other hand, etcd3 (using Raft) claims to have
achieved better performance than zookeeper and many Paxos-based
implementations (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQigKX0MxPw).

There are situations where Raft's leader is not so great. If the
datacenters containing replicas and clients are distant from each
other, people sometimes use agreement protocols derived from original
Paxos. The reason is that Paxos has no leader; any replica can start
an agreement; so clients can talk to the replica in their local
datacenter rather than having to talk to a leader in a distant
datacenter. ePaxos is an example.

关于Raft如何处理日志不一致的情况。
</p>

<p>
如果这里只考虑数据一致性问题的话，其实这里面选S2,S3都无所谓。S2,S3可以把自己的4,5都擦出掉，因为4,5都没有commit. 肯定不能将已经commit的日志回滚。
</p>

<pre class="example">
how can logs disagree after a crash?
  a leader crashes before sending last AppendEntries to all
    S1: 3
    S2: 3 3
    S3: 3 3
  worse: logs might have different commands in same entry!
    after a series of leader crashes, e.g.
        10 11 12 13  &lt;- log entry #
    S1:  3
    S2:  3  3  4
    S3:  3  3  5

Raft forces agreement by having followers adopt new leader's log
  example:
  S3 is chosen as new leader for term 6
  S3 sends an AppendEntries with entry 13
     prevLogIndex=12
     prevLogTerm=5
  S2 replies false (AppendEntries step 2)
  S3 decrements nextIndex[S2] to 12
  S3 sends AppendEntries w/ entries 12+13, prevLogIndex=11, prevLogTerm=3
  S2 deletes its entry 12 (AppendEntries step 3)
  similar story for S1, but S3 has to back up one farther

为什么不选择日志最长的作为leader
</p>

<pre class="example">
why not elect the server with the longest log as leader?
  example:
    S1: 5 6 7
    S2: 5 8
    S3: 5 8
  first, could this scenario happen? how?
    S1 leader in term 6; crash+reboot; leader in term 7; crash and stay down
      both times it crashed after only appending to its own log
    Q: after S1 crashes in term 7, why won't S2/S3 choose 6 as next term?
    next term will be 8, since at least one of S2/S3 learned of 7 while voting
    S2 leader in term 8, only S2+S3 alive, then crash
  all peers reboot
  who should be next leader?
    S1 has longest log, but entry 8 could have committed !!!
    so new leader can only be one of S2 or S3
    i.e. the rule cannot be simply "longest log"
